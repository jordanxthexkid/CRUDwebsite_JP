The files I used first was base code from an older website I had created in a different class.
I then edited the layout and added a couple javascipt features.
Then I moved onto the PHP file for the function that sent data to the database and worked on that file for a day or so.
I then helped a fellow coder a little, until I moved ont the delete function and I worked on that until the due date
The code in these files is used to create a Website uses CSS, HTML, Java script, SQL, and PHP.
The website was made to mimic a Gamestop order form but all the functions except submit do not work.
In order to use the current function that allows you to submit data to a database all you have to do is type in your name, pick in the drop down what game you want, and pick in the other drop down what type of game you want. 
Then hit submit and it will give you a notification that the order has been "Sent".
